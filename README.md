# michalbanas.dev

Hey there! This is my personal website and first website I have ever coded. It's a simple static website built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript/TypeScript and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). 

I also use [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for testing because it's my first automation love. I'm happy that you are here and I hope you will find something interesting for you.
